            Hi! My name is Olivia. I am a senior at Northeastern University studying Math and Business with a minor in Data Science. I am originally from Peabody, MA.
            I have always had a passion for health and fitness. I decided I wanted to take my passion to the next level and become a trainer.
            I have been a Yoga Sculpt instructor at CorePower Yoga for over a year now. Yoga Sculpt is a unique fitness class that blends traditional yoga poses with strength training and cardio bursts. As an instructor, 
            I’ve seen how this class challenges both the body and the mind, making it an excellent workout for all fitness levels.
        </p>

            The class is either one hour or forty-five minutes. It features Sun Salutation A, Sun Salutation B, Pushups & Biceps, Squats, Cardio, and more.
            The addition of free weights and plyometric movements creates a high-energy experience that boosts endurance and muscle strength. The idea is to use 3-5 pound weights, but for a high number of reps. 
            Unlike traditional yoga, Yoga Sculpt increases heart rate while improving balance and flexibility. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether you’re new to Yoga Sculpt or a seasoned participant, this workout is designed to leave you feeling strong and empowered!
